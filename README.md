# linux-scripts

This is a compilation of scripts written to help me install and configure utilities, tools and programs on my personal computers that run Ubuntu or Fedora.

All of the scripts are POSIX compliants and should work on any POSIX compliant shell(I use dash).

## Usage

`./run both` to both install and configure everything.

`./run config` to only configure everything.

`./run install` to only install everything.

`./run` to see options.

## Observations

- This is a fork of another repo, [fedora-scripts](https://github.com/arthurnunesc/fedora-scripts), extended to make it work on Ubuntu as well.

- Some configuration may not work on flavours of Fedora or Ubuntu that don't use Gnome.
